## My Academic App! by Juan Pablo Hurtado🧑‍🎓
The academic app provides an efficient platform for managing and tracking the academic performance of students. Users can easily register and log in to their accounts to access the app's features. Once logged in, they can view a comprehensive table that contains the entire data of students, teachers, subjects, and scores. The table is easy to navigate and provides all the necessary information in a clear and organized manner.

The app also allows users to update their profiles and view their academic records, including grades, scores, and subject performance. Teachers can use the app's features to manage their classes, track student performance, and assign grades.


With its user-friendly interface, comprehensive data management, and robust features, the academic app is the perfect tool for schools and institutions looking to streamline their academic processes.
